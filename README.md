# scrabble-program-java
I created this project for the IB English Scrabble tournament. It uses a variant of Appel and Jacobson's algorithm to create a computer program that can play scrabble. The algorithm is simplified since it uses a trie rather than a dawg. This program was originally written in C++ which has been translated to this Java program.
